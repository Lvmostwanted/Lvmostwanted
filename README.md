### Hi there 👋

### Hey there 👋
My name is Nathaniel - not really, I just like it as an alias ☺️, <br>
I currently live in the United Kingdom and have for the last 12 years of my life, <br>
Currently 16 years of age, I have extremely high hopes for my future career. <br> <br>

Later in my life as soon as I complete a Bachelor's degree, I hope to move to San Franciso with my best friend, <br>
This is to pursue our dream jobs - myself as a programmer and him as a penetration tester (whitehat of course).

# What languages do you program in?
This question is extremely simple - not many 😂, <br>
I have experience with Javascript, Typescript, Python, PHP and HTML. <br> <br>

I have not created any major projects as everything already exists in the world 😂, <br>
But my latest github release/project is/will be [SimpleDiscordJS](https://github.com/Lvmostwanted/SimpleDiscordJS), <br>
This NPM-based package is designed to make the creation of discord.js clients extremely easy for newer programmers. <br>
